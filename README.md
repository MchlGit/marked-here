# Marked Here: Spots worth a pause.

Marked Here is a web app that allows users to share and review scenic and accessible micro-spots. Users can share whatever they discover on their outdoor walks whether it be a tree in bloom, a colorful rock garden, or a randomly placed soda machine. Let's share the small natural/urban/suburban/etc. wonders with each other!
